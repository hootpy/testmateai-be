# TASK INSTRUCTION

- Context: user_api (app/api/user)

- Instruction:
    - Now we have the login function, create the dependency for secure endpoint.
    - the get user endpoint now will not need the id, since the user can only see the detail of their info only.
    - the same for update user name endpoint
